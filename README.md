WICKED: Wiggle Corrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data

This software is develop to remove sinusoidal wiggles, or Moire patterns, that apear on NIRSpec IFS data due to the undersampling of the PSF. 
The Moire patter can be modeled as a series of different sinusoidal waves. The codes uses a mixture of integrated spectrum templates and power-laws to model single-pixel  spectrum and fit the residual with a series of sinudoidal waves.
